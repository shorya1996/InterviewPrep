-- Step 1: Filter approved transactions from last 30 days
WITH recent_approved AS (
  SELECT
    account_number,
    amount,
    transaction_date
  FROM transactions
  WHERE decision = 'Approved'
    AND transaction_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 30) AND CURRENT_DATE

-- Step 2: Rank amounts per account and get total count
ranked_approved AS (
  SELECT

    amount,
    transaction_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_number ORDER BY amount) AS rn,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY account_number) AS cnt
  FROM recent_approved

-- Step 3: Pick the 95th percentile row per account (approximate)
account_thresholds AS (
  SELECT
    account_number,
    amount AS p95_amt
  FROM ranked_approved
  WHERE rn = CAST(cnt * 0.95 AS INT)

-- Step 4: Policy declines in last 3 days (correlated subquery)
declines_window AS (
  SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    t.account_number,
    t.transaction_date,
    t.amount,
    t.decision,

    (

        AND t2.decision = 'Policy Decline'
    ) AS decline_3d

  FROM transactions t
  WHERE t.transaction_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, 30) AND CURRENT_DATE

-- Step 5: Flag rebound pattern
rebound_flags AS (
  SELECT
    d.*,
    a.p95_amt,
    CASE 
      WHEN d.decision = 'Approved'
           AND d.amount > a.p95_amt
           AND d.decline_3d >= 2 THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END AS rebound_flag
  FROM declines_window d
  LEFT JOIN account_thresholds a
    ON d.account_number = a.account_number

-- Step 6: Backtest using claims data
rebound_with_claims AS (
  SELECT
    r.*,
    c.claim_entry_date,
    CASE 
      WHEN c.claim_entry_date BETWEEN DATE_ADD(r.transaction_date, 1) AND DATE_ADD(r.transaction_date, 10)

-- Final output
